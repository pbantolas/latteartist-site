Hey!

Since I posted on Reddit Thursday, 17 people have signed up for the list! (Not counting my own email, lol.)

Honestly, that gave me a push to take this more seriously. Your feedback has been super helpful. In this case, u/Fun-Storage-594 and u/Jacob876, sparked some solid improvements.

Here’s what I changed:

## Folders / Pattern-Based Home

u/Fun-Storage-594 suggested folders, and it clicked — the homepage shouldn’t dump all your pours. Instead, it should group them by pattern (like albums).

Now each pattern becomes its own little dashboard:

-   of pours
-   your latest one
-   and stats focused just on that shape

Cleaner, clearer, more focused.

## Better Visual Separation

u/Jacob876 pointed out the header/stats area would benefit from some visual separation. That made total sense, it immediately looked so much easier to scan when I made the change. Thanks for all the UI tips so far Jacob!

Check it out!

## About the Beta

I’m going to be away for ~2 weeks and won’t be actively developing during that time. So I wanted to ask:

Would you want to try a beta version this week, even if it’s incomplete or a bit buggy?

I can’t guarantee it’ll be fully approved by Apple in time, but I’ll do my best to push for it if there’s interest.

Reply to this email and let me know if you’re up for testing an early build.

Thanks for being here — it genuinely means a lot.

P.S. Got hit by a strange 90s design itch and accidentally made this fake ad. No regrets.
