Hey!

Since I posted on Reddit Thursday, 17 people have signed up for the list! (Not counting my own email, lol.)

Honestly, that gave me a push to take this more seriously. Your feedback has been super helpful. In this case, u/Fun-Storage-594 and u/Jacob876, sparked some solid improvements.

Here’s what I changed:

Folders / Pattern-Based Home

u/Fun-Storage-594 suggested folders, and it clicked — the homepage shouldn’t dump all your pours. Instead, it should group them by pattern (like albums).

Now each pattern becomes its own little dashboard:
• of pours
• your latest one
• and stats focused just on that shape

Cleaner, clearer, more focused.

Better Visual Separation

u/Jacob876 pointed out the header/stats area would benefit from some visual separation. That made total sense, it immediately looked so much easier to scan when I made the change. Thanks for all the UI tips so far Jacob!

Check it out!
